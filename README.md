## Git
The project is setted up with **Husky**, **Github Actions**, **Commitizen** and **Commitlint**.

1. In order to _commit_, just use _git commit_, this will initialize **Commitizen** to help you to make the _commit_ utilizing together the pattern that **Commitlint** need.
2. With **Husky** in the begin of each commit will be run a battery of tests
3. For _pushes_ and _pull_, **Git Hub Actions** will run tests again to make sure that everything work well
